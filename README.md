# Phase 0 - Training, Quizzes, and Certification
Teams earn points collectively and individually by participating in the available trainings, practice exams, and certifications. Individuals who do not submit a training deliverable score a zero. This zero will really hurt a team's points as these training deliverables (i.e., quizzes and exams) constitute 72 percent of total competition points.

Links to live Zoom meetings, recorded videos, and quizzes are in their respective folders in this repository. Additional training materials are in the [D4G Playlist](https://learning.oreilly.com/playlists/cd21a7c9-e5a3-4e71-80c3-c9d10a0457ee) on O'Reilly Media. Sign in with your UA email address and SSO.
